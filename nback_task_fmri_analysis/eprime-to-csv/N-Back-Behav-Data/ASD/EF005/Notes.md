he series was repeated at BL which is why there were 3 time points for data collection. 
The tech notes indicate that the participant terminated the scan early because they were
“uncomfortable” and the second series was also terminated pre-maturely 
because the participant stopped responding. 
No complete data exists for this participant at baseline.
