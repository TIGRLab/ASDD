EF015 : this participant didn’t participate in the treatment arm of the study, 
so there shouldn’t be time point 2 data.
I’m guessing he was re-scanned due to motion in the first? 
Or perhaps because he was not able to come in for baseline cognitive measures?
There is no record that I can find as to why he was scanned twice…
